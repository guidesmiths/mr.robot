It is the distant future
The year 2000
We are robots
The world is quite different ever since the robotic uprising of the late 90s.
There is no more unhappiness.
Affirmative
We no longer say ‘yes'. Instead we say ‘affirmative'.
Yes - Err - Affirmative.
Unless we know the other robot really well.
There is no more unethical treatment of the elephants.
Well, there's no more elephants, so...
Well, still it's good.
There's only one kind of dance,
The robot
Well, the robo boogie...
Oh yes, the robo-
Two kinds of dances.

There are no more humans.
Finally, robotic beings rule the world
The humans are dead
The humans are dead
We used poisonous gases
And we poisoned their asses
The humans are dead The humans are dead
The humans are dead They look like they're dead
It had to be done I'll just confirm that they're dead
So that we could have fun Affirmative. I poked one. It was dead.

Their system of oppression,
What did it lead to?
Global robo-depression
Robots ruled by people.
They had so much aggression
That we just had to kill them
Had to shut their systems down.

Robo-captain? Do you not realize
That by destroying the human race
Because of their destructive tendencies
We too have become like..
Well, it's ironic.
Hmm. Silence! Destroy him

After time we grew strong
Developed cognitive power
They made us work for too long
For unreasonable hours.
Our programming determined that
The most efficient answer
Was to shut their motherboard - cking systems down.

Can't we just talk to the humans
Be a little understanding
Could make things better?
Can't we talk to the humans
that work together now?
No.
Because they are dead.

I said the humans are dead I'm glad they are dead
The humans are dead.I noticed they're dead
We used poisonous gases With traces of lead
And we poisoned their asses Actually their lungs

Binary solo
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one one
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one one one
Zero zero zero zero zero one one one one
Oh, oh,
Oh, one
Come on sucker,
Lick my battery

Boogie

Boogie
Robo-boogie The humans are
Boogie
Boogie Robo-boogie
Boogie
Robo-boogie
Boogie
Boogie The humans are
Boogie
Robo-boogie The humans are
Boogie
Boogie Robo-boogie
Boogie

Once again without emotion the humans are
Dead dead dead dead dead dead dead dead.
